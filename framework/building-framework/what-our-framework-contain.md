# What our framework contain

Now we know the disadvantages of writing selenium automation scripts without using a framework. \(Like can't run in groups, lot's of code duplication in order to log or report etc.,\).

So in this framework we are going to add all the necessary elements which are required for a good framework.

1. Logging.
2. Reporting.
3. Mailing the report if needed.
4. Ability to run in groups.
5. Page Object Model for clean and less redundant code.
