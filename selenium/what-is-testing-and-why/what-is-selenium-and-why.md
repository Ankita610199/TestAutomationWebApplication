# What is Selenium and Why?

Well if we have a basic knowledge of Java the you’ll be having an idea of what is a library or jar file. Libraries are pre-written Java code for specific purposes so that they can be included in a Java project whenever required.

 **Selenium** is one of such kinds of open source and insanely popular Library\(s\) where the code for automating a user interaction with a browser is pre written. So as soon as we add selenium libraries to our project we’ll be having all the features that we need to simulate the actions of a user on browser. 

As Selenium defines itself.,

> **Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you**
